**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

My professional background is in healthcare and health informatics field. I believe that we mainly focus on optimizing healthcare processes, implementing technological solutions and innovations, and improving data management systems to streamline clinical workflows and enhance patient outcomes. While these efforts are valuable and have been contributing to efficiency and effectiveness within healthcare system, I think that they may not have always fully accounted for ethical considerations and inequities in healthcare access and outcomes.
I believe that we need to redirect our priority and focus on integrating ethics and equity components into every aspect of healthcare. This includes examining the potential impact of technological innovations and process improvements on different patient populations, particularly those who are marginalized or underserved. It means actively seeking out and addressing biases in data collection and analysis to ensure that our insights and recommendations are not perpetuating existing disparities.
This can be achieved by fostering a culture of ethical awareness and inclusivity within the healthcare organizations. Healthcare professional, patients and caregivers should be encouraged to engage and participated in decision making processes and dialogue surrounding ethical dilemmas and social determinants of health, and advocating for policy and practices that promote equity within the healthcare system.
To adjust my approach to incorporate ethics and equity in healthcare I will consider collaborating with community organizations and stakeholders to better understand the needs of the patients and particularly vulnerable populations and work on the projects that their priority is to improve patient outcomes while reducing health inequities.
My commitment to integrate ethics and equity into my work in healthcare and health informatics is rooted in a deep understanding of the profound impact that these factors play on patient outcomes and societal well-being. By embracing this approach, we can move closer to realizing the vision of a healthcare system that is equitable and compassionate for all.
